* Fix problems with the variable spectrum of students at each test.

  - Idea: Get the lastest list of students for each class and use it to
   create a new .dat file appending the grade to the current test or
   whitespaces when one doesn't show up to the previous dat file. Then
   another program would use this final .dat to create the HTML file.
